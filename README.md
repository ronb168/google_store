# google_store

## About the Project

Is it possible to predict the success of an app in the Google Store (Android) that will be reflected in the number of installs and high ratings?
The purpose of this question is to provide app developers with a platform through which they can gain insights and guidance regarding the potential to develop an app that is considered "successful".
We defined a successful app to be an app that is downloaded 1 million times
To get a "successful" app, we defined a successful app to be an app that is downloaded 1 million times and is rated at least 4 stars.  
By analyzing successful applications we have explored the various features that can lead to success such as price, size, genre, and more.
