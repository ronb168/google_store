### About the Project

Is it possible to predict the success of an app in the Google Store (Android) that will be reflected in the number of installs and high ratings?
The purpose of this question is to provide app developers with a platform through which they can gain insights and guidance regarding the potential to develop an app that is considered "successful".
To get a "successful" app, we set a minimum download of over one million downloads and a rating above 4.0. 
We want to check what are the main features which can lead to a successful app such as price, size, genre, and more.
